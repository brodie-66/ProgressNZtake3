                Treet Yourself was founded by Caleb Diprose and myself (Brodie Murdoch) in order to provide a service to our beloved community. Both of us come from rural settings, which gave us both a keen passion and knowledge for environmental sustainability. With Caleb's strong management skills, combined with my passion for articulation, we both progressed our ambition of creating an Environmental legacy to serve our community for generations to come, as we began our fight against climate change. Soon, Treet Yourself incorporated a new team member, Zach Robertson. Zach brought his excellent Minecraft skills to our service, allowing us to branch out in newer and better directions. With Zach's ability and love for building projects on Minecraft, we were able to develop 3D digital representations of the projects we were planning, and were able to share these with our customers. This allowed us to include our customer in the design process in ways most other companies cannot, giving us a cutting-edge advantage, as well as being able to get an understanding of our customer's vision. Later on, we incorporated a fourth member into the team. David Enriquez brought with him an impeccable understanding of accounting, which has allowed us to build an impeccably robust financial record, which has meant that we can make more accurate predictions for the future. The Treet Yourself team does not stop there. We soon incorporated the help of our year 7-8's William Pike challenge students, building up a future network of environmentally focused individuals to expand and grow with our mutual mission of providing a service of environmental sustainability to our community, and our world.
